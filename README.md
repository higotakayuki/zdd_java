zdd_java
========

#what is this?
This code is zero-suppressed binary decision diagram (ZDD), wchich can provide compressed representation of sets of combinations. This is implemented by using Java8.This code is one of the simplest implementation of ZDD and we can easily understand how ZDD works. 

If you need faster version of ZDD, you should try to implement the same code by using C++. C++ code can be ten times faster or more than Java one.
